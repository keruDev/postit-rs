Postit is a CLI utility aimed to help you complete your tasks.
You can also save your tasks to keep track of them later.

## From 0.1.x to 0.2.x

The 0.1.x minor marked the beginning of postit's development, but the best is yet to come.
As of 0.1.x, postit featured csv and json file support, as well as some basic commands to
manage tasks and the configuration file.

By bumping the version to 0.2.x, it is intended to mark the first great step of postit to
becoming a more serious product.

To migrate from 0.1.x to 0.2.x, you'll need to change the `--path` flag to `--persister`
(not that hard, I know).

This minor will be focused on providing support for more database systems (MongoDB or MySQL)
along with some more file extensions (XML) and more commands to make task management simpler.

Hope to cross paths in future versions :)

## Features

Although `postit` is still in early development, it is alive and keeps growing!
Here are some of its current features and some planned ones as well: 

Features:
- [Commands](#commands) and [flags](#flags) to manage tasks and files.
- Supported file and database formats to persist data (described in the [persisters](#persister) flag).
- Configuration file to change postit's behavior (more info in the [Configuration](#configuration) section).
- Tasks are displayed differently depending on their priority and wether they are checked or not.

Roadmap:
- [x] XML support
- [ ] MongoDB support
- [ ] MySQL support
- [ ] Tasks filtering and sorting

## Configuration

postit's behavior can be changed using the `.postit.toml` file.

You can check out its possible fields in the [docs](https://docs.rs/postit/latest/postit/struct.Config.html) or down below:
- `persister`: where tasks are stored (the `-p` or `--persister` flag can override this).\
  It can be one of the supported persisters (file or database).
- `force_drop`: if true, allows dropping tasks without them being checked.
- `force_copy`: if true, allows overwriting files on copy if they already exist.
- `drop_after_copy`: if true, drops files after copying.

## Environment variables

- `EDITOR`: used to open your configuration file and edit it.
- `POSTIT_CONFIG_PATH`: specifies where the config file is located (by default, `.postit.toml`).

## Commands

The commands currently available are (click to go to a use example):
- [`sample`](#sample)
- [`view`](#view)
- [`add`](#add)
- [`check`](#check)
- [`uncheck`](#uncheck)
- [`drop`](#drop)
- [`copy`](#copy)
- [`clean`](#clean)
- [`config`](#config)

You can also use the `--help` flag for additional help on every command.

## Examples

### sample

Syntax: `postit sample`

Populates a persister with fake data so you can test other commands. This command
takes the `persister` defined at `.postit.toml` (or the `-p` flag, if provided):

```sh
postit sample
```

```csv
1,Task,low,false
2,Task,med,false
3,Task,high,true
4,Task,none,true
```

### view

Syntax: `postit view`

Takes the `persister` defined at `.postit.toml` (or the `-p` flag, if provided)
to show the list of current tasks:

```sh
postit view
```

```csv
1,Task,low,false
2,Task,med,false
3,Task,high,true
4,Task,none,true
```

### add

Syntax: `postit add <TASK>`

Adds a task with the format `id,content,priority,checked`. 
- **id**: a unique unsigned integer.
- **content**: description of the task.
- **priority**: `high`, `med` (default), `low` or `none`.
- **checked**: `true` or `false`.

To add a task, use the format `content,priority`.

If priority is left blank, then it will be assigned `med`:

```sh
postit add "New task"
```

```csv
1,Task,low,false
2,Task,med,false
3,Task,high,true
4,Task,none,true
5,New task,med,false    (new element)
```

To assign a different value to the task's priority:

```sh
postit add "New task,low"
```

```csv
1,Task,low,false
2,Task,med,false
3,Task,high,true
4,Task,none,true
5,New task,low,false    (new element)
```

### check

Syntax: `postit check <IDS>`

Checks tasks if they are unchecked.

```sh
postit check 2,3
```

```csv
1,Task,low,false
2,Task,med,true         (changed)
3,Task,high,true        (not changed)
4,Task,none,true
```

### uncheck

Syntax: `postit uncheck <IDS>`

Unchecks tasks if they are checked.

```sh
postit uncheck 2,3
```

```csv
1,Task,low,false
2,Task,med,false        (not changed)
3,Task,high,false       (changed)
4,Task,none,true
```

### drop

Syntax: `postit drop <IDS>`

By default, tasks must be checked to be dropped.

```sh
postit drop 2,3
```

```csv
1,Task,low,false
2,Task,med,false        (not dropped)
// 3,Task,high,true     (dropped)
4,Task,none,true
```

You can set the `force_drop` config to `true` to drop tasks wether they are checked or not.

```sh
postit drop 2,3
```

```csv
1,Task,low,false
// 2,Task,med,false     (dropped)
// 3,Task,high,true     (dropped)
4,Task,none,true
```

### copy

Syntax: `postit copy <OLD_PATH> <NEW_PATH>`

Copies a file's contents into another:

```sh
postit copy tasks.csv tasks.json
```

By default, if the file at `<NEW_PATH>` exists, `postit` will refuse to
overwrite that file in case you are using that file as a backup or you simply
don't want to overwrite it.

You can set the `force_copy` config to `true` to overwrite it anyways.

In the other hand, if you want to copy your file and delete the old one, you can
do it by setting the `drop_after_copy` config to `true`. This will delete the file
located at `<OLD_PATH>`.

### clean

Syntax: `postit clean`

Deletes all tasks from a persister. This command takes the `persister` defined
at `.postit.toml` (or the `-p` flag, if provided):

```sh
postit clean
```

### config

Syntax: `postit config <COMMAND>`

Used to manage the config file. These are the available commands:
- `init`: creates the `.postit.toml` file.
- `edit`: executes the editor (`EDITOR` env var) to change configs.
- `drop`: deletes the config file (default values will be used at runtime).

You can also check the [Configuration](#configuration) section where each config
field is explained and there is a link to the official docs.

## Flags

### persister

Syntax: `postit <COMMAND> --persister <PATH_OR_CONN>`

The `--persister` or `-p` flag specifies where the tasks will be read from and saved to.
It can be used on the following commands:
- [sample](#sample)
- [view](#view)
- [add](#add)
- [check](#check)
- [uncheck](#uncheck)
- [drop](#drop)
- [clean](#clean)

There are currently 4 supported persisters:

- Files
  - csv (e.g.: tasks.csv)
  - json (e.g.: tasks.json)
  - xml (e.g.: tasks.xml)

- Databases
  - SQLite (e.g.: tasks.db, tasks.sqlite or tasks.sqlite3)

A use example:
```sh
postit view --persister tasks.csv 
```

## Testing

To run postit's tests, use this command:
```sh
cargo test -- --test-threads=1
```

You can also use `tarpaulin`, configured in the `.tarpaulin.toml` file.
It is slower, but shows line coverage (not branch coverage):
```sh
cargo tarpaulin -- --test-threads=1
```

The reason why tests are run synchronously is to not overwrite existing files,
control the execution flow (creation and cleanup of temp files) and keep them
as lightweight as possible, as they don't use external dependencies.
